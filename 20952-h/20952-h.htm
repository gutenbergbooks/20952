Boohoo, boohoo, boohoo, boohoo!<BR>
My mother says I can't take Sue<BR>
And Grace and Maud and Clarabel<BR>
And Ruth and Beth and sweet Estelle,<BR>
Unless I pack them with our things.<BR>
Oh dear! oh dear! my heart it wrings<BR>
To put them in that hot, dark place,<BR>
With paper wrapped around each face.<BR>
I'm sure they all would suffocate<BR>
Or meet some other dreadful fate.<BR>
I'd gladly take them on my arm<BR>
And keep them safe from every harm,<BR>
But mother says that that won't do;<BR>
She draws the line at more than two.<BR>
I'd like to know what she would say<BR>
To sending me packed in a tray.<BR>

THE QUARREL<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The Wooden Dog and the China Cat<BR>
Face to face in the doll-house sat,<BR>
And they picked a quarrel that grew and grew,<BR>
Because they had nothing else to do.<BR>
Said the dog, "I really would like to hear<BR>
Why you never stir nor frisk nor purr,<BR>
But sit like a mummy there."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Up spoke in a temper the china puss,<BR>
Glad of an opening for a fuss:<BR>
"Dear Mr. Puppy, I can't recall<BR>
That I ever heard you bark at all.<BR>
Your bark is a wooden bark, 'tis true,<BR>
But as to that," said the China Cat,<BR>
"My mew is a china mew."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So they bristled and quarreled, more and more,<BR>
Till the baby came creeping across the floor.<BR>
He took the cat by his whiskers frail,<BR>
He grasped the dog by his wooden tail,<BR>
And banged them together&mdash;and after that<BR>
Left them, a wiser Wooden Dog<BR>
And a sadder China Cat.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now, children, just between you and me,<BR>
Don't you think in the future they will agree?<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Eight of us went to a party&mdash;<BR>
The nicest ever given.<BR>
There was apple fluff, and frosted stuff,<BR>
And cake and candy and fruit enough,<BR>
But seats for only seven!<BR>

Eight of us hurried homeward<BR>
After the happy treat,<BR>
With run and bound; yet there were found<BR>
Only the tracks on the dusty ground<BR>
Of seven pairs of feet!<BR>

Eight of us got back safely,<BR>
And seven told with glee<BR>
Of all we'd done, and the feast and the fun&mdash;<BR>
But one of us was a silent one.<BR>
Now, which can that one be?<BR>

Topsy-Turvy came to me<BR>
On our last year's Christmas tree.<BR>
She is just the queerest doll,<BR>

Now you see her, cheeks of red,<BR>
Muslin cap upon her head,<BR>
Bright blue eyes and golden hair,<BR>
Never face more sweet and fair.<BR>
Presto! change!  She's black as night,<BR>
Woolly hair all curling tight,<BR>
Coal-black eyes, thick lips of red,<BR>
Bright bandanna on her head.<BR>
She's not two, as you'd suppose,<BR>
When Topsy comes, Miss Turvy goes.<BR>
Perhaps it's as it is with me.<BR>
Sometimes another child there'll be,<BR>
And mother says, "Where is my Flo?<BR>
I wish that naughty girl would go."<BR>

A china doll's head and a half finished sum,<BR>
A thimble, a handkerchief&mdash;sticky, I fear&mdash;<BR>
A dolly's blue cap and some jackstones are here.<BR>
In the other are marbles and fishhooks and strings,<BR>
Some round shiny stones and a red top that sings,<BR>
A few apple cores and a tin full of bait,<BR>
A big black jack-knife in a sad bladeless state.<BR>
And now I wonder how many can guess<BR>
Which pocket Bob owns and which one does Bess?<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I give my pony corn and hay,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">With oats to tempt him twice a week;</SPAN><BR>
I smooth and curry every day<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Until his coat is bright and sleek;</SPAN><BR>
At night he has a cosy stall;<BR>
He does not seem to care at all.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I mount him often, hurriedly,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And ride him fast and ride him far;</SPAN><BR>
With whip and spur I make him fly<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Along the road where robbers are;</SPAN><BR>
But when I've galloped madly home<BR>
He is not wet or flecked with foam.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He does not plunge against the rein,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Nor take a ditch nor clear a rail.</SPAN><BR>
He does not toss his flowing mane,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">He does not even switch his tail.</SPAN><BR>
Oh, well, he does his best, of course;<BR>
He's nothing but a hobby-horse!<BR>

My father's books are made of words,<BR>
As long and hard as words can be,<BR>
They look so very dull to me!<BR>
No pictures there of beasts and birds,<BR>
Of dear Miss Muffet eating curds,<BR>
And things a child would like to see.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
My books have pictures, large and small,<BR>
Some brightly colored, some just plain,<BR>
I look them through and through again.<BR>
Friends from their pages seem to call,<BR>
Jack climbs his bean-stalk thick and tall,<BR>
I know he will not climb in vain.<BR>

Here comes Red-Riding-Hood, and here<BR>
The Sleeping Beauty lies in state,<BR>
The prince will come ere 'tis too late!<BR>
And this is Cinderella dear.<BR>
The godmother will soon appear<BR>
And send her to her happy fate.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, father's books are very wise,<BR>
As wise as any books can be!<BR>
Yet he wants stories, I can see;<BR>
For really, it's a great surprise<BR>
How many picture-books he buys,<BR>
And reads the fairy tales to me!<BR>

THE LITTLE BOOK PEOPLE<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
At half past eight I say "good night" and snuggle up in bed.<BR>
I'm never lonely, for it's then I hear the gentle tread<BR>
Of all the tiny book people.  They come to visit me,<BR>
And lean above my pillow just as friendly as can be!<BR>
Sometimes they cling against the wall or dance about in air.<BR>
I never hear them speak a word, but I can see them there.<BR>
When Cinderella comes she smiles with happy, loving eyes,<BR>
And makes a funny nod at me when she the slipper tries.<BR>
Dear Peter Pan flies in and out.  I see his shadow, too,<BR>
And often see his little house and all his pirate crew.<BR>
I think they know I love them and that's why they come at night,<BR>
When other people do not know that they've slipped out of sight;<BR>
But I have often been afraid that while they visit me<BR>
Some other little boy, perhaps, may stay up after tea,<BR>
And when he tries to find them on the pages of his book<BR>
He cannot see them anywhere, though he may look and look!<BR>
That's why I never stay awake nor keep them here too long.<BR>
I go to sleep and let them all slip back where they belong.<BR>

When Charlotte is playing croquet<BR>
